## Project Description
In today's highly competitive job market, securing an interview is a **significant challenge**, particularly for computer science students who often submit hundreds of applications before receiving a response. The initial interview plays a crucial role in determining whether a candidate advances in the hiring process or must restart their job search. However, many job seekers struggle with resume optimization and interview preparation, as traditional resources provide only generic advice without personalized feedback. This lack of tailored guidance leaves candidates uncertain about their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

Rezoome addresses these challenges by offering an AI-powered platform designed to enhance both resume quality and interview performance. By leveraging advanced AI-driven analysis, the platform provides **detailed resume feedback**, **generates personalized interview questions** based on the user‚Äôs experience and desired job role, and delivers **real-time insights** to help refine responses. Through the simulation of real-world interview conditions, Rezoome equips users with the **confidence**, **communication skills**, and **strategic preparation** needed to improve their overall performance and increase their chances of securing meaningful job opportunities.
