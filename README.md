## Mock Interview Simulation

### Project Description
Our project is a **mock interview simulation** and **resume review** that uses **AI** to generate **realistic interview questions** and give **feedback** on the resume and interview question answers. 

This targets people who want practice and feedback on the job interview process and resume in one streamlined application. It aims to solve how there aren't very clear ways to practice the interviewing process by yourself. With the modern advancements in AI, we can use it to give better and more relevant questions and feedback with the changing landscape of the job market. The questions and feedback will be adapted depending on your resume and what type of job you are applying for. The interview practice will imitate online interviews with live audio and visual recordings.
